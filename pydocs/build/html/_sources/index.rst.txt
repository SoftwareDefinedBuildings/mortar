Welcome to pymortar's documentation!
====================================

PyMortar is a handy-dandy library for Python 3 (may also work on Python 2, but this is untested) that makes it easy to retrieve data from the Mortar API.
PyMortar wraps the underlying `GRPC API  <https://git.sr.ht/~gabe/mortar/tree/master/proto/mortar.proto>`_ in a simple package.
The Mortar API delivers timeseries data using a streaming interface; PyMortar buffers this data in memory before assembling the final Pandas DataFrame. **PyMortar will happily fill up your computer's memory if you request too much data**; you will need to be careful!

Installation
============

PyMortar is available on pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pymortar>=1.0.0

It depends on pandas and some GRPC-related packages. These should be installed automatically. You may find it helpful to install PyMortar inside a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or use the [PyMortar Docker container](quick-start.md).
